### Key Components
- **Role-Based Authentication**: Server-side middleware validates user permissions
- **Admin Panel**: Complete web interface for user and song management
- **Permission System**: Three-tier role system (Admin/Player/User)
- **Security**: Database-backed role validation with JWT tokens

## üéÆ How to Use

### First Time Setup
1. **Open your browser** and go to `http://your-pi-ip:3000`
2. **Create an account** using the register form (automatically gets "User" role)
3. **Create an admin user** (see Admin Setup below)
4. **Start voting** on existing songs or upload new ones!

### Default Accounts Setup
**Both admin and player accounts are automatically created on first startup!**

When you start the server for the first time, it will automatically create:

**üëë Admin Account:**
- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `admin123`
- **Role:** `admin` (full system control)

**üéß Player Account:**
- **Username:** `dj_player`
- **Password:** `player123`
- **Role:** `player` (music playback control)

```bash
# Start the server (both accounts will be created automatically)
node server.js

# Or with Docker
docker-compose up -d
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT SECURITY STEPS:**
1. **Login immediately** with both accounts
2. **Change the default passwords** in user profiles
3. **Consider changing usernames** for better security
4. **Use the admin account** to manage user roles

### Manual Account Creation (Alternative)
If you need to create additional accounts:

```bash
# Generate password hash
node -e "const bcrypt = require('bcryptjs'); bcrypt.hash('your_password', 10).then(h => console.log(h));"

# Create additional accounts in database
sqlite3 database/jukebox.db
INSERT INTO users (username, password, role, email, created_at)
VALUES ('newadmin', '$2a$10$your_hash_here', 'admin', 'admin@example.com', datetime('now')),
       ('dj_backup', '$2a$10$your_hash_here', 'player', 'dj@example.com', datetime('now'));
.exit
```

### Adding Music

**Method 1: Direct file copy (bulk)**
```bash
# Copy music files directly to the music directory
cp /path/to/your/songs/* ./music/
# Restart to scan new files
docker-compose restart jukebox
```

**Method 2: Web upload (individual files)**
- Use the "Upload Music" tab in the web interface
- Drag and drop or select multiple files
- Metadata is extracted automatically

# SELECT * FROM users;       # View all users
# SELECT * FROM songs;       # View all songs
# SELECT * FROM votes;       # View all votes
```

## üåê Network Access & Integration

### Access from Other Devices
```bash
# Find your Pi's IP address
hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'

# Access from any device on your network
# http://YOUR_PI_IP:3000
```

### Integration with Umbrel/Home Server
If you're running this on a Pi with Umbrel or other services:

1. **Add to your dashboard** (Dashy, Homer, etc.)
2. **Set up reverse proxy** through nginx-proxy-manager
3. **Create subdomain** like `jukebox.yourdomain.com`

### Firewall Configuration
```bash
# Allow access through UFW (if enabled)
sudo ufw allow 3000
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**üê≥ Container won't start**
```bash
docker-compose logs jukebox
docker system prune  # Clean up if disk space issues
```

**üåê Can't access from other devices**
```bash
# Check if service is running
docker-compose ps

# Verify port is open
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep :3000

# Test local access first
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

**üéµ Music files not showing**
```bash
# Check file permissions
ls -la music/

# Verify supported formats (MP3, WAV, FLAC, M4A, OGG)
file music/*.mp3

# Restart to rescan
docker-compose restart jukebox
```

**üìä Database errors**
```bash
# Check database permissions
ls -la database/

# Reset database (‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Deletes all users and votes!)
docker-compose down
rm database/jukebox.db
docker-compose up -d
```

**üë• Role-related issues**
```bash
# Check user roles in database
sqlite3 database/jukebox.db "SELECT username, role FROM users;"

# Update user role manually
sqlite3 database/jukebox.db "UPDATE users SET role='admin' WHERE username='your_username';"

# Clear browser cache if role changes don't show
# Browser Dev Tools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Clear storage
```

**üîê Permission errors**
```bash
# Check JWT token contains role information
# Login again to refresh token if role was changed

# Verify middleware is applied to endpoints
docker-compose logs jukebox | grep "requireAdmin\|requirePlayer\|requireUser"
```

### Performance Optimization

**For Raspberry Pi 5:**
- ‚úÖ Use high-quality SD card (Class 10+)
- ‚úÖ Consider USB 3.0 storage for large music collections
- ‚úÖ Limit concurrent users (5-10 recommended)
- ‚úÖ Use compressed audio formats (MP3) for faster loading
- ‚úÖ Regular cleanup of old uploads

### Getting Help

**Logs are your friend:**
```bash
# Application logs
docker-compose logs -f jukebox

# System resources
htop
df -h

# Network connectivity
ss -tlnp | grep :3000
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Important Security Settings

1. **Change the JWT secret:**
```bash
# Edit .env file
JWT_SECRET="your-unique-secret-key-here-make-it-long-and-random"
```

2. **Role-based security:**
   - Admin accounts should use strong, unique passwords
   - Regularly audit user roles and permissions
   - Limit admin account creation to trusted users only
   - Monitor admin actions through application logs

3. **Network security:**
   - Only expose to trusted networks
   - Consider VPN access for remote admin use
   - Use HTTPS in production (via reverse proxy)

4. **File permissions:**
```bash
# Secure your directories
chmod 755 data/ database/ uploads/
chmod 644 .env
```

### Role System Security
- **Server-side validation**: All permissions are validated server-side, not just client-side
- **Database-backed roles**: User roles are stored in database and validated on each request
- **JWT token security**: Tokens include role information but expire appropriately
- **Admin restrictions**: Admins cannot delete themselves or demote their own roles
- **Audit trail**: All admin actions are logged for security monitoring

## üöÄ Advanced Configuration

### Custom Domains with Reverse Proxy

If you have nginx-proxy-manager or similar:

1. **Create new proxy host**
2. **Forward to:** `localhost:3000`
3. **Domain:** `jukebox.yourdomain.com`
4. **Enable SSL** (Let's Encrypt)

### Environment Variables Reference

```bash
# .env file options
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key              # Authentication secret (REQUIRED)
NODE_ENV=production                     # Environment mode
